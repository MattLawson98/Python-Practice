MineSweeper is a Python based game that implements tkinter to create the popup app that is seen when run. This game was created using the guide created by freecodecamp.org on https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqbGRZx4xUc&ab_channel=freeCodeCamp.org. This is my first version of mineSweeper that I have made, I do plan on adding a timer and diffuculty scaling to this in later versions.
